#Â ZetaChain
ZetaChain is an EVM-compatible L1 blockchain that enables omnichain, generic smart contracts and messaging between any blockchain.

# Prerequisites
Go 1.20
Docker and Docker Compose (optional, for running tests locally)
buf (optional, for processing protocol buffer files)
jq (optional, for running scripts)
Components of ZetaChain
ZetaChain is built with Cosmos SDK, a modular framework for building blockchain and Ethermint, a module that implements EVM-compatibility.

zeta-node (this repository) contains the source code for the ZetaChain node (zetacored) and the ZetaChain client (zetaclientd).
protocol-contracts contains the source code for the Solidity smart contracts that implement the core functionality of ZetaChain.
Building the zetacored/zetaclientd binaries
